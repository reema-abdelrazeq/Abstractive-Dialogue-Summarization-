# 📄 Abstractive Dialogue Summarization Using T5 Transformer
This project leverages the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model for abstractive dialogue summarization. The goal is to train the model to generate concise, human-like summaries of conversations, ideal for applications like customer support, chatbots, and more! 🤖💬

# 🎯 Objective
The aim of this project is to enhance the efficiency of summarizing long dialogues by retaining the most important information. T5 is fine-tuned to generate abstractive summaries that capture the essence of a conversation, making it easier to digest and understand.

# ⚙️ Technologies Used
T5 Transformer (Hugging Face)
TensorFlow / PyTorch
Hugging Face Datasets
Python 3.x
